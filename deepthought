DT BUSINESS ANALYST ASSIGNMENT
Task 1: Daily Clinic Inventory Micro-Audit
Context:
I am acting as a Clinic Business Analyst for a small clinic pharmacy where:
1.Medicines are not barcoded
2.Sales entries are typed manually
3.Small errors happen frequently
4.Doctor time is very limited
My responsibility is not full reconciliation, but to design a daily micro-audit system that:
1.Detects sales-entry mistakes early
2.Improves billing discipline among staff
3.Prevents inventory shocks at month-end
The system should take only 20–30 minutes per day and work in real clinic conditions.

STEP 1 — Identify High-Risk Medicines
I do not check all medicines daily because that would take too much time and staff would stop taking it seriously.
Instead, I create a High-Risk Medicine List based on where errors are most likely.
Criteria I used
1.High daily sales volume
2.Medicines entered with different names
3.Frequently prescribed by the doctor
I focus my daily checks only on these medicines.

STEP 2 — Normalize Sales Entry Names
Since sales are entered manually, the same medicine appears under different names in the sales register.
For example:
“Dolo”, “Dolo kind” → Dolo 650
“Azithro 500”, “Azithromycin” → Azithromycin 500
Before checking stock, I mentally map all such variations to one master medicine name.

STEP 3 — Daily Expected Stock Check
For each high-risk medicine, I calculate the Expected Closing Stock using this simple logic:
Expected Closing Stock = Opening Stock + Purchases − Sales
I only do this calculation for high-risk medicines, not for all items.
Example: Dolo 650
Opening Stock = 1,000
Purchases = 500
Sales:
Dolo → 10
Dolo 650 → 15
Dolo kind → 5
Total Sales = 30
Expected Closing Stock
= 1,000 + 500 − 30
= 1,470
Actual Closing Stock (given) = 1,440
Difference = −30
This difference indicates a likely sales-entry or quantity mistake that should be checked the same day.

STEP 4 — Quantity Pattern Check
I quickly look for abnormal patterns such as:
Sudden spike in sales for a medicine
Zero sales for a medicine that is usually prescribed daily
These patterns usually indicate:
1.Typing errors
2.Missed billing
3.Wrong quantity entry
This step helps catch errors without doing detailed reconciliation.

STEP 5 — Random Physical Stock Check
Every day, I randomly pick 1 or 2 medicines (preferably from the high-risk list) and do a quick physical count.
The medicine chosen changes daily.
This random check:
1.Keeps staff alert
2.Improves billing discipline
3.Does not increase workload
I avoid checking the same medicine every day.
I do this because otherwise the system will show false mismatches even when stock is correct.

STEP 6 — Daily Summary for Doctor
At the end of the micro-audit, I prepare a very short summary for the doctor.
Daily Inventory Health Summary
Medicines checked today
Any mismatch found (Yes / No)
Action taken
The doctor does not see raw data or calculations — only this summary.

Why This Micro-Audit System Works:
1.Takes only 20–30 minutes per day
2.Works without barcodes or advanced systems
3.Detects small errors before they become big problems
4.Improves staff discipline without blaming
5.Keeps doctor involvement minimal
Instead of doing heavy audits at month-end, this system uses small daily discipline to keep inventory clean.

Task 2: Patient Care & Communication System Design
STEP 1 — Categorize Patient Messages
I first divide all patient communication into three simple types.

Type 1: Automated Messages
Messages that do not need human judgment.
Examples:
Appointment confirmation
Follow-up reminder
“Your report is ready” message
These messages can be sent automatically.

Type 2: Staff-Handled Messages
Messages that need a response but not a doctor.
Examples:
“When should I take this tablet?”
“Can I change my appointment?”
Staff replies using standard instructions.

Type 3: Doctor-Only Messages
Messages related to medical risk.
Examples:
New symptoms
Side effects
Post-treatment complications
Only these messages are forwarded to the doctor.

STEP 2 — Simple Google Sheet Setup
I use one Google Sheet with three basic columns:
Patient Name	Follow-up Date	Message Type
Message Type:
Auto
Staff
Doctor
This sheet controls who handles the message.

STEP 3 — Daily Workflow
After the visit, the follow-up date and message type are noted
Each day, staff checks the sheet
Automated messages are sent first
Staff replies to routine queries
Only doctor-level cases are escalated

STEP 4 — Protecting Doctor Time
Doctor does not check WhatsApp directly
Doctor sees only serious cases
All routine communication is filtered
This reduces interruptions and improves focus.

Why This Simple System Works:
Very easy for staff to follow
No new software needed
Saves doctor time
Patients still receive timely responses
Scales as patient volume grows

Conclusion:
This simple patient communication system:
Removes WhatsApp chaos
Keeps care organized
Protects doctor attention
Works in real clinic conditions
